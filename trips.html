		<h3>The Places I've Been to:</h3>

		<h4>Rome</h4> 
		<p class="hrome">Rome was definetely not built in a day. If you decide to visit this timeless city, then you will need more than one day, more than two days, and even more than three days to explore it! This city is a collection of piazzas, open-air markets, and astonishing historic sites. Toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain, contemplate the Colosseum and the Pantheon, and sample a perfect espresso or gelato before spending an afternoon shopping at the Campo deâ€™Fiori or Via Veneto. And just enjoy the most delicious pizza you have ever tried.</p>

		<h5>Prague</h5>
		<p class="pprague">Prague is a city of stunning buildings and majestic squares. If you have only a few days for exploring this city full of fairytale features, then you are lucku that its centre is pretty compact. From Wenceslas Square on one side to Prague Castle on the other is just a 30 minutes stroll. You can devote the entire day to visiting Prazsky hrad (Prague Castle). Then you can spend an amazing evening at a classic Czech tavern. You can also climb and enjoy views from the following towers and attractions: Old Town Hall Tower, Old Town Bridge Tower, Lesser Town Bridge Tower, Klementinum, Petrin, Jindrisska Tower and Vysehrad.</p>

		<h6>Marsa Alam (Egypt)</h6>
		<p class="marsa">Marsa Alam is a place of white sand beaches, coral reefs teeming with turtles, dugongs and dolphines, and...annoying local service. No matter who you are, no matter how you look, no matter where you are sitting, this "frindly" service will find you, offering you either "the best massage you have ever had" or "the most exciting tour of local desert". These adventures are not so "amazing" how it is presented but there are more truly amazing things you can do in Marsa Alam. Off the coast of Marsa Alam are some of Egypts most unspoilt reefs. Port Ghalib is an exclusive new marina development north of Marsa Alam. Its tree-lined quay brims with international restaurant chains, high-quality eateries, and a selection of upmarket shops.</p>
